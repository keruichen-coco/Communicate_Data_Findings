# Bike Trip Exploration
## by Kerui Chen

## Dataset

> This dataset explores Bay Wheels trip data from January 2019 to December 2019.This dataset contains 2506983 data which all have details of each bike trip, including duration, start/end time, start/end station information, bike ID, and user type. https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels/system-data


## Summary of Findings

> I am mostly interested in finding out the location related features to the trip durations and who would be more interested in long trips, causuals or members? And how the seasonality plays a part in the bike usage in different time period. 

Based on my exploration and visualization, we found that there are patterns for top start/end station which we can assume that they are in the centeral commute of city, and subscribers use bike more often than causual customers, but they are usually using the bike for short and frequent trips, like school, work, etc, since most of the trips are in 3 to 10 km range. Although there is no clear seasonality presented in the finding, I did find that people like to use bikes more frequently in summer and fall times, but unexpectedly have longer trip distance near the winter and spring. 


## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentations, I mainly focus on the relationship between number of trips and other variables, like distance, months and yuser type. The most important I want to point out is the Monthly Distance for Customers and Subscribers map at the end, which indicates the difference between customers and subscribers. The peak time for customer use is in December and mostly in short distance trips as well. For subscribers, the distributions are rather even except that the December is the low month, and March and April are the months with higher uses.
